<h1>Story</h1>

<main>


















<div class="no-break story-chunk">
    <h4><a href="puzzles.html">Where are my glasses?</a></h4>
    <p>
  It&rsquo;s March 13, 2020. You open the windows and sunlight streams into
  your room. It&rsquo;s a beautiful spring day: the weather is warm, there&rsquo;s nary a
  cloud in the sky, and there certainly isn&rsquo;t a deadly virus ravaging the globe.
</p>

<p>
  It&rsquo;s also finally, <em>finally</em> the day of the 2020 Galactic Puzzle Hunt!
  In just a few short hours you&rsquo;ll be knee-deep in puzzles with your fellow
  teammates.
</p>

<p>
  You open up your laptop to check if there are any
  updates when you realize that things are still out of focus. Of course: you
  need your glasses. But where are they? You begin to search your room&hellip;
</p>

<p>
  Several hours go by. You&rsquo;ve ransacked your whole house, but the only things you
  found were some odd pieces of paper with strange writing on them. Increasingly
  nervous that you&rsquo;re going to miss the start of the hunt, you try to calm
  yourself down: Treat it like a puzzle. You&rsquo;re good at puzzles after all.
</p>

<p>
  You stare at the papers you gathered. They&rsquo;re hard to make out since you can&rsquo;t
  see very well; parts of them are still blurry. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll get clearer
  over time, and maybe reading and understanding these pages can help jog your
  memory.
</p>

</div>





<div class="no-break story-chunk">
<h4 class="spoiler"><a href="/puzzles">20/20 Foresight</a></h4>
<p>
  <b class="spoiler">FORESIGHT IS 2020</b>, of course! You’ve lost your glasses before, and it
  was not a fun time. So you built yourself a system for finding them again.
  Whenever you might lose your glasses, you leave clues on the other sights
  around your house, and those clues always lead you back to your glasses. What
  foresight you had! If only you remembered what all the four sights were&hellip;
</p>

<p>You think one of them might be your night vision goggles.</p>
</div>











<div class="no-break story-chunk">
    <h4><a href="round/night-vision-goggles.html">Night Vision Goggles</a></h4>
    <p>
  You grab your goggles and head to your basement. It&rsquo;s pitch black down here,
  and without them you&rsquo;d hardly be able to see anything at all. You put them on
  and you notice some green glows emanating from various spots. More puzzles
  to solve no doubt!
</p>

</div>



















<div class="no-break story-chunk">
    <h4><a href="round/periscope.html">Periscope</a></h4>

    <p>
  How could you have forgotten
  the periscope that came with your bathtub submarine!
  You step up to your bathtub and peer down into its murky depths. It sure is
  far deeper than you remember. No matter, you think, and you board your
  trusty submarine. It’s a good thing you bought this—you thought you’d
  never use it. You head underwater and start looking for clues through its
  complicated periscopic system.
</p>


</div>



















<div class="no-break story-chunk">
    <h4><a href="round/microscope.html">Microscope</a></h4>
    <p>
  While underwater, you were struck by an idea to check the water quality in your
  bath. You grab a pipette, fill it up, and head over to your home lab where you
  squeeze some drops onto a slide and place it under your
  microscope. You&rsquo;re taken aback by the strange colors and shapes you see through
  the lens.
</p>

</div>



















<div class="no-break story-chunk">
    <h4><a href="round/binoculars.html">Binoculars</a></h4>
    <p>
  You’ve exhausted all the options for seeing things inside your house, but you
  still have your rather large backyard to explore. And what better tool to help
  you explore it than your fine pair of binoculars! You head outside and press
  the lenses to your eyes. There sure are some sights out here&hellip;
</p>

</div>



















<div class="no-break story-chunk">
    <h4><a href="puzzle/four-sights.html">Four Sights</a></h4>
    <p>You’ve retrieved the clues you left for yourself at the four sights, but what now? Sounds like there are other sights you haven&rsquo;t taken into account&hellip;
