    <p>We are presented with 5 breakfast foods we need to eat—er, solve. We’ll discuss each one individually and then the
overall puzzle’s solution.</p>
<h4>Toast</h4>
<p>Each line on the toast has a morse code letter hidden in the middle of it (shown in green below).</p>
<p><img src="breakfast-time/morse.png" style="width: 100%"></img></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Morse</th>
<th>Letter</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>- - .</td>
<td>G</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>. -</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- -</td>
<td>M</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.</td>
<td>E</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Translating the Morse code to letters, we get GAME.</p>
<h4>Eggs</h4>
<p>Each egg clues a series of progressively shorter words, with a ? at the end. Once we solve enough of the clues, we can
notice that the words are contained within one another, like eggs.
For example, CLASSIC contains LASSI contains ASS contains S.</p>
<p>The four eggs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>C(L(A(S)S)I)C</li>
<li>B(O(T(H)E)R)S</li>
<li>B(A(L(O)N)E)Y</li>
<li>F(L(O(W)E)R)Y</li>
</ul>
<p>The center letters spell out SHOW.</p>
<h4>Pancakes</h4>
<p>Each pair of pancakes clues a pair of words where one is missing a letter:</p>
<ul>
<li>WINK INK</li>
<li>STAIR STAR</li>
<li>PINT PIN</li>
<li>BATH BAT</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking the letters dropped from the second words, in order, we get WITH.</p>
<h4>Waffle</h4>
<p>The numbers on the waffle represent four games of minesweeper with slightly adjusted rules. We need to place mines such
that each square’s number indicates the number of mines on adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent, or across the waffle
boundary, or itself) squares.</p>
<p><img src="breakfast-time/waffle-base.png" style="width: 100%"></img></p>
<p>For the top left waffle, we know that neither the zeros nor the ones that are adjacent to them can have any syrup
(mines) placed in them. Thus, the ones in A1, A2, D4 and C4 have only one adjacent cell each that can have a syrup
(mine) in them. So cells A1, B1, D3 and D4 have syrup. Now C3 has its one adjacent syrup, so C2 can’t have any syrup in
it, and we need to put syrup in C1, D1 and D2 to finish the waffle.</p>
<p>For the bottom left waffle, the corners each have exactly 2 adjacent cells, so they must both be filled with syrup. Now
the four cells in the middle have all met their constraints, so none of their additional neighbors (each other) can have
syrup. That means we need to put syrup on the corners to finish the constraints from the edge cells.</p>
<p>For the top right waffle, we start with the threes in A6, A7, D6 and D7. They each have exactly three neighbors, and so
all three of them must have syrup. Once we fill in those 12 cells, all the cells have their constraints met, so we
cannot add any more syrup and the waffle is complete.</p>
<p>Finally, for the bottom right waffle, we start with the threes in G8 and F5. We fill in their three neighbors with
syrup. Now, consider the 2 in F8 and the 1 in E7. They share two neighbors, at most one of which can be filled with
syrup. Thus, the other neighbor of the 2, G8, must be filled with syrup. Following the same logic with the mirror pair
of 1 and two in G5 and H6, we can fill F5 with syrup. Now, G6 and H7 cannot be filled with syrup because G7 has its
constraint satisfied, so the remaining syrup to satisfy H6 must go in H5. Using similar logic, we can deduce the last
syrup goes in E8.</p>
<p><img src="breakfast-time/waffle-solved.png" style="width: 100%"></img></p>
<p>Looking at the completed grid, we see that the syrup spells out the word LION.</p>
<h4>Fries</h4>
<p>We start by solving the clues on the two fries provided:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Clue</th>
<th>Answer</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>“That was close!”</td>
<td>WHEW</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Game franchise since 2001</td>
<td>HALO</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He sang about a pickle</td>
<td>ARLO</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Breakfast, e.g.</td>
<td>MEAL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Punch sound</td>
<td>WHAM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Loser of a famous race</td>
<td>HARE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“The first lady of song”</td>
<td>ELLA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shepherd’s product</td>
<td>WOOL</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>At some point while solving the clues, we may notice that they are four letters long and can be written in the holes of
the remaining fry. We only have enough room to write 16 letters, which means the letters must be shared between the
answers. In fact, the same set of letters are used in both sets of answers, one down and one across. This is a crossword
puzzle.</p>
<p>Reading the diagonal of the crossword grid (represented above in two ways), we get WALL.</p>
<h4>Breakfast Time!</h4>
<p>Once we’ve eaten all the elements of the breakfast, we can put it all together. The clue phrase is GAME SHOW WITH LION
WALL. If we need an extra nudge, the top of the unblurred menu mentions a full English breakfast. The game show with a
lion wall, which happens to be English, is <strong>ONLY CONNECT</strong>, the answer to this puzzle.</p>



    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>At some point during brainstorming for the hunt, Abby suggested that we have a round of even easier puzzles before our
first ‘intro’ round of easier puzzles. That round didn’t make it into the final plans, so I wrote this puzzle in the
hopes of having some accessible minipuzzles early on in the hunt.</p>
<p>Thanks to Nathan for suggesting the breakfast theme and Jess for the incredible art!</p>
