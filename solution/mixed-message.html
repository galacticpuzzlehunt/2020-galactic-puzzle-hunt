    <p>The puzzle presents us with a 3x3 grid of overlapping letters which we can traverse forwards
or backwards via the arrow keys.
Some experimenting reveals that if you refresh the page, the middle cell of the grid always starts on the same
pair of overlapping letters, U and w, and the middle cell repeats every 29 frames.
If we write down and disentangle these 29 frames, we can recover a pair of "mixed-up messages"</p>
<p><code>Uncleartextfillsthispuzzlebut / weclearlyneedonecharactereach</code></p>
<p>The font makes some of the letters tricky: o from "one" and l from "fills" look like b when they overlap,
and n from "one" and l from "fills" look like h. Notably, "clear" overlaps from both parts of this message.
If we start to disentangle the other eight cells, there are two observations to make:</p>
<ol><li> Each of the cells is the result of overlapping two books, read letter-by-letter without punctuation or spaces.</li><li> Furthermore, each book has had one character's name completely erased. This might be discovered by chance while transcribing
        some of the texts, or it is hinted by the central message, which suggests looking for additional non-overlapped letters in other cells.
    This observation might also be made by turning on autoplay, watching the text go by for awhile, and noticing
    clear runs of letters that stand out.</li></ol>

<p>The character is often the main protagonist of the book. There is also a message at the start of each book saying who has
been erased, in case curious solvers navigate there. The easiest method to check who has been erased is to autoplay the
letters and look for clear runs, and then use the jump button to finish off the books that haven't been determined yet.</p>

<p>The central message is a figurative "mixed message" in the sense that it also tells us we need to extract one
character from each pair of books. Each pair of literary characters has the same length (using their full name,
disregarding any titles, removing spaces as in the book). If we write their names over one another (using standard capitalization, as in the book)
there is exactly one letter in each pair that cleanly overlaps to make a new letter.
For example, overlapping "JeanValjean" and "OliverTwist", the only
clean overlap is l/T = T.
Reading clockwise from the upper left corner spells out the answer to the puzzle, <strong>TODDLERS</strong>.</p>



    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>In the original version of the puzzle, you could not pause the letter streams
(with the intent that you would have to do bigram disambiguation on-the-fly; ouch):</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="mixed-message/mixed-msg.gif" width="300px"></div>

<p>but testsolvers <em>hated</em> this; they recorded a video and stepped through the video.
Interestingly, they didn't have trouble noticing that character names
were erased in this format!</p>
<p>Even in its current form, this puzzle is certainly a grind to solve. Is it fun? Reception was mixed.
If you made it through the puzzle, congrats!
I probably wouldn't write the puzzle this way again. During writing, I had a distinct moment
of decision where I likely went the wrong way. I knew that
I wanted to overlay two books on top of each other, but I needed some way to
connect each pair of books to extract the answer. They could either be connected
in a "syntactic" way, e.g. the current puzzle, or in a "semantic" way, e.g. both books are a modern retelling
of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, say.
The semantic way would likely have replaced some of the grind with a small a-ha, and who among us
does not love a small a-ha?</p>
<p>We heard of several teams using various technical exploits to do data collection.
In the data file sent to your computer, the book text is permuted by sending the character at position <em>i</em> to position <i>i*k</i> (mod length) for
some obfuscated number <em>k</em>
(along with some other obfuscation).
The URL (which allows teammates to share progress/state) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base-64</a> encoding
of the current indices into the obfuscated texts.
Prior to the hunt I was under the impression that the most you could do with this is
figure out the numbers <em>k</em> and do some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse">modular arithmetic</a>
to un-permute the novels (a nontrivial amount of work, which some teams bravely did).
But since 0 is a fixed point of the permutation, some teams randomly tried "0,0,0,&hellip;" and jumped to the
start of the novel&#151;where the message "JealValjeanwasclearedfromthisbook" appears.
In a sense the messages at the start of the book were doing their job of telling
what was going on to solvers who navigated there, but this was an easier-than-intended way
to find them (vs using the jump button).</p>
<p>Several teams also sent us this <a href="https://2020.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/mixed-message?m=MTE0MDk3MiwzOTgzMjQsNzQ4MzMsNjc3MzEyLDEwMTEwMiw2OTA5NSw4MjQ2MSwxMzA1NywwLDAsMTQ5NzM3LDExODY3NCwyMDUzODgsNDQzOTYsNzIzNDMsNTMzODgsMTg3MzIsMTc1NTI=">completely blank</a> page.
An impressive find! Another masochistic thing to do is find a page that clearly spells out some 8-letter word. </p>
