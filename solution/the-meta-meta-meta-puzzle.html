    <p>This puzzle is presented as a meta puzzle titled “Meta Puzzle 0”, along with a list of 11 unsolved puzzles numbered 1, 2, .., a, b. However, each of the 11 “feeder” puzzles turns out to be another meta puzzle, consisting of some number of feeder puzzles (ranging from 5 to 15). This pattern continues, where each unsolved puzzle is another meta, continuing indefinitely. (Some feeder puzzles in deeper levels are not meta puzzles and hence are already solved, although a fraction of those answers are blurred in the blurry version.)</p>
<p>In addition, each meta puzzle has a “hint” consisting of one or two symbols, and each meta puzzle that is not Meta Puzzle 0 comes with an (unlimited) answer checker. We can infer from these observations that we are in a (computer-generated) puzzle hunt with infinitely many levels of meta puzzles, and the goal is to solve Meta Puzzle 0.</p>
<p>The first step is to figure out what each symbol in the hint means. We can do this by looking for puzzles with a high fraction of revealed answers and look for common patterns among the words. (If we go down one branch long enough, eventually most puzzles will have only one hidden answer.) By looking through enough examples, intuiting from the symbols themselves, and/or using the answer checker to confirm our guesses, we can figure out the meaning of each symbol:</p>
<p>(The notes in brackets below are some explanations on how the symbol connects to the extraction method.)</p>
<table><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Explanation</th></tr><tr><td><code>[</code></td><td>First letter [The open bracket hints that the extraction is from the start of the word.]</td></tr><tr><td><code>]</code></td><td>Last letter [Similarly, the close bracket hints at extracting from the end.]</td></tr><tr><td><code>|</code></td><td>Median letter (only applies to words with odd length) [Median extraction can be done by centering all answer words and looking down the middle column.]</td></tr><tr><td><code>\</code></td><td>Diagonalization (n-th letter of the n-th answer) [The backslash is literally a diagonal.]</td></tr><tr><td><code>/</code></td><td>Anti-diagonalization (n-th last letter of the n-th answer) [The forward slash is literally an anti-diagonal.]</td></tr><tr><td><code>=</code></td><td>Double letter (consecutive repeated letter, e.g. AA) [Equal sign suggests identical letters.]</td></tr><tr><td><code>-</code></td><td>“Sandwiching” letter (two identical letters with one letter in between, e.g. A in ABA) [The symbol suggests a “weaker” form of equality, i.e. one less bar than the equal sign.]</td></tr><tr><td><code>+</code></td><td>“Sandwiched” letter (one letter sandwiched by two identical letters, e.g. B in ABA) [The plus sign can be seen as the opposite of the minus sign, or as marking the middle of the connection.]</td></tr><tr><td><code>*</code></td><td>Mode letter (the unique letter that appears the most number of times, which is also always 3 times in this puzzle) [The asterisk indicates multiplication in many cases.]</td></tr></table>

<p>Note that each symbol extracts exactly one letter from each answer. When there are two symbols in the hint, the first symbol is used for ordering (the extracted letters will be a consecutive subset of the alphabet, which we can use to order the answers) and the second symbol is used for extraction.</p>
<p>After figuring out the meaning of the symbols, we can now start solving puzzles with less answers revealed, and eventually solve the feeder puzzles of Meta Puzzle 0:</p>
<table><tr><th>Feeder</th><th>Answer</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>CORRESPONDENCE</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>DISCUSSION</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>FORMULA</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>LIGHTNING</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>MEDITERRANEAN</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>NATIONALIZATION</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>OFFER</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>PSYCHOLOGIST</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>RECORDER</td></tr><tr><td>a</td><td>SCHEME</td></tr><tr><td>b</td><td>WILLINGNESS</td></tr></table>

<p>Note that these answers are given in alphabetical order. In addition, the hint to Meta Puzzle 0 consists of two new symbols: <code>_?</code>, which means that we need a new ordering and extraction mechanic.</p>
<p>For ordering, we can notice that each answer has a different length between 5 and 15 inclusive, and all possible lengths are represented, which suggests that we should order by length. [The underscore is also frequently used for enumerations in puzzle hunts.]</p>
<p>The extraction becomes more clear once we notice that each meta answer can be extracted using the same mechanism used to obtain the answer. For example, Meta Puzzle 7 uses the double letter extraction, and its answer OFFER also has a pair of double letters. This extraction method is known as recursion, where we apply the same step used to obtain the result on the result itself. [The question mark also suggests a “wild card”, which can be substituted by any other symbol.]</p>
<p>Doing these two steps gives the answer <strong>FERRIS WHEEL</strong>, which calls back to the frequent instances of guessing the answer with only some of the letters throughout this puzzle, a technique also known as <em>Wheel-of-Fortune</em> (WoF).</p>

<p>(Note: The two answers that use diagonalization/anti-diagonalization extraction also happen to give the right letters in the original alphabetical order, which means that the ordering and extraction steps can technically be done in either order.)</p>



    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>After <a href="https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/the-meta-puzzle.html">The Meta Puzzle</a> from GPH 2019 and the <a href="https://perpendicular.institute/round/infinite/">Infinite Corridor</a> and <a href="https://perpendicular.institute/round/giga/">⊥IW.nano</a> metas from MIT Mystery Hunt 2021, it only makes sense to combine all three ideas to make an infinitely nested meta puzzle that is not a meta puzzle of the hunt.</p>
<p>Obviously, for this idea to be feasible, there can only be finitely many mechanics involved, and they need to be simple enough to be generated quickly on request. This inspires the typical ISIS-type pure meta mechanics, where each feeder answer contributes exactly one letter to the meta answer. This also provides an excellent opportunity to introduce common extraction techniques to newer solvers.</p>
<p>Some technical details of this puzzle:</p>
<ul>
<li>We used <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/">SCOWL</a> to generate the answers (where the words are weighted by their common-ness so that puzzle answers are more likely to be common words). Words with accents or variant spellings were avoided so as to not confuse non-American solvers. We also removed a bunch of undesirable words from SCOWL and from this <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/">Offensive/Profane Word List</a>.</li>
<li>Other than Meta Puzzle 0, all other puzzles are computer-generated. The meta puzzle ID (treated as a hexadecimal number) is used as the RNG seed to make sure that the puzzle generation is deterministic. </li>
<li>The density of hidden answers decreases as the depth increases (roughly as (depth+1)<sup>−1/2</sup>), <s>although there will always be at least one hidden answer per meta to make sure that the entire puzzle is truly infinite (well, only bounded by the largest integer that our website can handle, at least).</s> (I capped the depth when implementing server-side answer persistence to avoid having to store arbitrarily many arbitrarily long strings on the server. Did any team hit the cap? —Brian)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to Brian Chen for converting the original Python prototype to the web version.</p>
