    <p>This text adventure is a flimsily-disguised game of <a href="http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Dominion">Dominion</a>. This is clued through much of the flavor, but the most reliable way to find or confirm it is probably to look at the names of the first five locations, which are all Dominion cards.</p>
<p>More precisely, the game is a completely deterministic simulation of a single <a href="http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Gameplay#Action_phase">Action Phase</a> of one player's turn. The basics of how the Action phase in Dominion works:</p>
<ul>
<li>You start each action phase with one <strong>Action</strong>, an invisible currency. Typically, you will also have five cards in hand from the previous turn (there are many situations that could lead to this not being true, but they don’t occur in this puzzle).</li>
<li>Then, as long as you have any Actions left, you can spend one Action to play one <strong>Action card</strong> from your hand. To do so, you put the card “into play” (so that, at this point, it is already no longer in your hand; the order in which this happens matters for some cards) and then follow the instructions on the card. Many cards give stock effects of the following form:<ul>
<li><strong>+X Card(s)</strong> means to draw X cards right away and put them into your hand.</li>
<li><strong>+X Action(s)</strong> gives you X Actions, enabling you to play more Action Cards in that phase.</li>
<li><strong>+X Coin(s)</strong> and <strong>+X Buy(s)</strong> affect your ability to buy cards in the following Buy Phase. They are not important for this puzzle, except that you can see when you get +X Coins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most other card effects are explained in English prose. Some cards have effects that trigger on events other than when they are played; none of those effects or triggers occur in this simulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text adventure’s state corresponds to the Dominion game state as follows: At any given time, the list of accessible locations in the text adventure is the list of cards the player has drawn or played so far. In the beginning, there are unsurprisingly five locations, and they are in alphabetical order. Newly drawn cards are always added to the easternmost end of the universe; the cards are never reordered or relocated. In particular, cards stay in their “physical positions” even after being played, although they are out of the player’s hand for the purposes of card logic. None of the playable actions in this puzzle allow the player to make any decisions (e.g. none of them make the player discard any cards or potentially reorder cards in their deck after looking at them).</p>
<p>The text adventure only displays some of the card effects. Card draw, through +X Cards or otherwise, corresponds to new locations becoming accessible; how energetic you feel corresponds to how many Actions you have; and coins are, well, coins. Buys, victory points, and effects on other people are not represented. No cards are gained, into the discard pile or elsewhere, although it isn’t necessary to assume this to solve the puzzle. There are no tokens, Events, or Ways either (at least, they aren’t provided as options).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the cards have been defaced, so solvers must use the effects of cards as they're played to identify all of the cards. The appendix includes a more detailed solve path for determining this. In order, the full list of cards in the deck is:</p>
<ul>
<li>#1: Will-o'-Wisp</li>
<li>#2: Will-o'-Wisp</li>
<li>#3: Will-o'-Wisp</li>
<li>#4: Bridge</li>
<li>#5: Bridge</li>
<li>#6: Bridge</li>
<li>#7: Familiar</li>
<li>#8: Menagerie</li>
<li>#9: Menagerie</li>
<li>#10: Bridge</li>
<li>#11: Bridge</li>
<li>#12: Sage</li>
<li>#13: Sage</li>
<li>#14: Familiar</li>
<li>#15: Patrician</li>
<li>#16: Patrician</li>
<li>#17: Patrician</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Platinum (not defaced)</li>
<li>Colony (not defaced)</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining cards in the deck are not accessible. The list of defaced cards occur in runs of identical cards. For each group, index the size of the group into the card name:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will-o'-Wisp ×3 → L</li>
<li>Bridge ×3 → I</li>
<li>Familiar ×1 → F</li>
<li>Menagerie ×2 → E</li>
<li>Bridge ×2 → R</li>
<li>Sage ×2 → A</li>
<li>Familiar ×1 → F</li>
<li>Patrician ×3 → T</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer is <strong>LIFE RAFT</strong>.</p>

<p><span class="dominion-aside">Portions of text formatted like this are asides addressed to people who are deeply familiar with Dominion mechanics, meant to explain implausible corner cases. Most solvers can ignore them.</span></p>
<p>The Dominion Strategy wiki is very useful for finding cards based on their locations: in particular, the table on <a href="http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/List_of_cards">List of Cards</a> is sortable by various columns, and articles like <a href="http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Cantrips">Cantrips</a> list all cards satisfying some conditions.</p>
<p>Cards #8 and #9, Menagerie, are likely among the easiest cards to completely uniquely determine. Menagerie is the only card that usually draws 1 card, but sometimes draws 3 cards, without giving the player any choices. (Seer is somewhat plausible, and Apothecary is also possible, but both cards let you choose an order to put the cards back in and it’s fairly clear that not all remaining cards are identical in some plays. <span class="dominion-aside">There aren’t even any cards that draw 0 or 2 cards and exactly 1 action without any choices that could take a +1 Card token from Pathfinding or Teacher. Shanty Town comes pretty close, but gives too many +Actions. Also, the fact that Crossroads draws no cards even if these cards are in hand implies that these are true Menageries and not Estates that play a Menagerie via Inheritance, and similarly for other cards.</span>)</p>
<p>From there, there are a few choices for the first few cards #1 to #3, which usually draw 1 card but sometimes 2. The main candidates are Patrician and Will-o’-Wisp. Vagrant and Magpie are vaguely possible, but since all our cards are actually playable right now during the Action Phase, both would only be able to draw multi-type cards as their second card, which is easy to rule out. <span class="dominion-aside">Dual-type cards are worth considering, but as above, the lack of draw from Crossroads provides a second reason that the cards cannot be dual-type Action-Victory cards. Magpie might warrant a second look for the case in which the cards are also Treasures due to Capitalism, but you can see that most of your cards don’t give +Coins when played, and there just aren’t that many cards that have +Coin in their text but don’t actually give you any +Coin. Tournament with a +1 Card token and an opponent that makes decisions according to some bizarre deterministic rule is ruled out by not giving a coin.</span> If you make the leap of faith that the first three cards are the same, that narrows it down to Will-o’-Wisp. But the clearest way to disambiguate is to see that any one of them draws Menagerie if and only if at least one of cards #4 to #6 was played first <span class="dominion-aside">which incidentally also ensures there isn’t any automatic cost reduction from some Princed card or Canal or something</span>. There are no cards that increase the costs of cards, so only Will-o’-Wisp can behave this way. Combined with the +1 Coin and lack of +Action on cards #4 to #6, we can also uniquely identify all three as Bridges.</p>
<p>Now, the behavior of Menagerie can also be used to verify that these clumps of cards with similar behavior are identical. From there, you can use Menagerie to determine that cards #10 and #11 are the same as cards #4 to #6 or see how they interact with Will-o’-Wisp to identify them as Bridges as well.</p>
<p>From there, #12 and #13 often skip to drawing Platina depending on what cards have been played so far without giving any choices. Sage is basically the only card that has this behavior.</p>
<p>(Note that we have not identified #7 or #14 yet.)</p>
<p>Cards #15 to #17 are once again cards that may draw 1 or 2 cards. They can be verified as Patricians by observing that they draw a Platinum as the second card if and only if not all five Bridges have been played. (In order to play all five Bridges, you must avoid playing the Smithy to have enough Actions. One way to do so is to follow the optimal play order below until you are asked to play Smithy, and then don’t play it.)</p>
<p>Finally (and we fully expect most solvers to short-circuit the answer before this step), we have to identify #7 and #14. We’ll start with #14:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you play all non-Bridges in order, #12 (Sage) will draw #14, which proves that it costs at least 3 coins. <span class="dominion-aside">This inequality is even true if its cost was reduced via Ferry or something.</span></li>
<li>However, playing a Bridge right before #12 in that order makes it skip #14, which proves that it doesn’t cost at least 4 coins.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if you skip a Will-o’-Wisp in that play order and play it right after #12, you can see that Will-o’-Wisp doesn’t draw it. Furthermore, this is still true if you add Bridges (you can add up to 4 comfortably), which proves that #14 doesn’t cost at most 6 coins.</li>
<li>From the fact that #14 costs neither at least 4 coins nor at most 6 coins, we can conclude that its cost does not consist solely of Coins. There’s only one such card that gives +1 Card and +1 Action with no choice: Familiar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can verify that #7 is the same card as #14 with Menagerie. One way to do this: follow the optimal play order below until before you play the second Menagerie, and play the Smithy instead, which also draws up to #14 and leaves you with a Will-o'-Wisp, #7, a Menagerie, a Bridge, two Sages, and a Familiar in your hand, with three Patricians and infinite Platina remaining in the deck. Then play a Sage to skip the Patricians and get a Platinum. The fact that Menagerie will not draw 3 cards for that hand proves that #7 is the same as one of the other cards in your hand, and then you just need to prove it's none of the other candidates.</p>
<p>Here is a play order that enables you to draw the maximum depth into your deck. It's a little tricky to construct. Here are some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>In total, playing all cards (that draw cards) would draw 19 cards at a minimum. The cards that can draw a variable number of are the three Will-o'-Wisps, which can each draw an additional card, for a total of +3; the two Menageries, which can each draw two additional cards, for a total of +4; and the three Patricians, which can each draw an additioanl card for a total of +3. All together, that's 19+10 cards, and this turns out to be achievable. (It's worth considering if using Sage to skip cards can draw deeper, because it's not obvious how to convert that effect into raw hand size. But it can't because skipping a card with Sage is equivalent to drawing that card and immediately playing it as a "Pig" (a neutral cantrip that gives +1 Card, +1 Action). The cards after Sage that it can possibly skip (i.e. the second Sage, Familiar, and Patrician) are all at least as good as Pigs, so this often hurts and never helps.)</li>
<li>You have just enough +Actions to play every action card and finish with 0 Actions, but you can't actually get there or the game ends, so you need to avoid playing at least one of the six terminals, the Smithy and the five Bridges. Playing all but one Bridge is enough to make Menagerie draw 3 cards.</li>
<li>Overall, maximizing the Menageries' draw is probably the harshest constraint. In particular, you cannot get rid of Platina, so a Menagerie can never draw 3 cards after you've drawn at least two Platina. And a mishandled Sage is liable to skip directly to Platina. So basically you want to proc the Menageries as soon as possible. This puts corresponding pressure to proc Will-o'-Wisps early, because they cannot proc on Platina either. That said, it's not actually as tight as the play order below indicates because drawing <em>one</em> Platinum before playing your second Menagerie is fine.</li>

<p>(The last card is a Colony solely because there are only 12 copies of Platinum in the game, so you couldn’t have had all 12 in your deck without causing your City to draw an extra card.)</p>
<p>There are some additional global constraints provided the puzzle is solvable without them. The opening implies that there are, somehow, more than ten different expansions involved in this game without Black Market being involved, which is a suggestion to look at cards from expansions different from each other and from the cards you start with in your hand. But all cards should be identifiable without that constraint.</p>
<h4>Is this game state possible?</h4>
<p>There are exactly ten distinct action cards from the supply, but none of them are Exorcist or grant Boons, so there is no apparent way to get Will-o’-Wisp. Probably the easiest way to arrive at the game state is if Way of the Mouse is in the game and set aside Druid during setup, which set aside The Swamp’s Gift during Setup. In that case it’s really easy to get Will-o’-Wisps.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could believe that Black Market is actually a Supply pile, and although you avoided it, your opponent bought it and got a bunch of cards through it, including Masquerade; they then used Masquerade to pass you some of their other Black Market Action cards, for some reason.</p>



    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>In keeping with the theme of flimsy disguises, I spent a bunch of time editing the <a href="http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/List_of_cards">Dominion Wiki's List of Cards</a> and in particular the sort orders of the various columns under a throwaway username, initially just to try to make the puzzle more accessible to people who used that page to look for cards, and later because it was strangely addictive trying to assess the expected value of various cards’s effects and categorizing the stranger effects in ways that could be easily notated.</p>
<p>I think something like the idea of "What if the locations in a text adventure were Dominion cards?" has been lurking in the back of my head for a while, but the concrete event that made it crystallize when I was testsolving <a href="https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/oh-the-places-youll-go/">Oh, the Places You'll Go!</a> from the 2021 MIT Mystery Hunt. Looking back at my testsolve sheet, there are actually a lot of locations in that puzzle that are also Dominion cards, but I think the one that really made me go “I can’t believe this is a real phrase for a location and not just a Dominion card” and convinced me I should write this puzzle was Fishing Village.</p>
<p>I’m not actually very good at Dominion. I bully the naïve AI on dominion.games when I’m bored and still lose like a quarter of the games. Maybe this isn’t a surprise because, if this puzzle is any indication, I care more about bizarre corner case interactions of cards than about the actual strategy&hellip;</p>
<hr />
<p>When I wrote my first draft, I wrote in Puzzlord,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this is theoretically solvable but it might be practically impossible /shrug</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had two fairly smooth testsolves, which made me think the puzzle might be easier than I expected, but based on the solves during the hunt it looks like my initial instinct was closer.</p>
