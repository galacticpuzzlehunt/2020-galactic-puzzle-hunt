<p>Of course, there are many ways to go about this. Once we make a valid quiz, four students take the quiz and we
    receive their answers. For example:</p>

<p><i>Good job! All four students in the competition have completed your quiz, though they may not have gotten all the
        answers
        right. If you're not happy with their performance, you can always change some questions and the students will
        complete
        your new quiz. They're very studious and very consistent.</i></p>

<p>Some of the students get some of the questions wrong. We notice that all of the questions that are wrong contain
    letters, and we can deduce that some of the students have incorrect beliefs about the values of certain letters at
    certain times. In fact, each student has one letter whose value they always think is three times what it should be.
    These letters can be determined by cycling through different solutions to the questions using letters, such as questions
    23 through 25.

    For students one, two, three, and four, the tripled letters are L, U, T, and Z respectively. Thus, the answer to this puzzle
    is <strong>TRIPLE LUTZ</strong>.</p>




    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>Many of the challenges in this puzzle should be familiar to teachers with experience making math quizzes: designing questions to test whether students are making common mistakes, making sure the quiz won't upset students too much, doing extra work to make sure questions have "nice" answers and constants, etc. That said, because of how weird the students' requests are, this is probably the "Make Your Own X" puzzle that least resembles the usual real-life task of making X. It's hard to imagine a student who would get upset if adjacent questions on their math quiz have large edit distance!</p>
