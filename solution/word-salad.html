<p>This is a puzzle about etymology! The puzzle starts with 28 dictionary entries
written in Puflantu, for which eight of them are missing the word being defined.
In addition to the guide provided, translations of every word obtainable by
pronoun infixing and pluralization from the 2019 Puflantu dictionary are
automatically given.</p>
<p>Solvers must determine the meanings of the words from context and similar known
words, as well as the identities of the things being described in the eight
"wordless" entries. Each of those entries concludes in a sentence describing the
Puflantu etymology of the word, which must be pieced together from those
instructions and the provision of the relevant morphemes in other clues. The
entire list is presented in alphabetical order by Puflantu spelling, which can
help with translation.</p>

    <h2 id="appendix">
Full Walkthrough
</h2>
    <p>Though it does help to be familiar with Puflantu from its 2019 appearance, it is
intended that all the important information from that hunt is provided either in
the "Crash Course" or in the dictionary. A few other things can help in guessing
the meanings of the words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that nouns and adjectives always end with vowels, and verbs
    (and the occasional adverb) always end in consonants.</li>
<li>Many words are obtained from pieces of other Puflantu words &#x2013; use the
    dictionary search at the bottom of the puzzle page to see if pieces of an
    unknown word appear anywhere else. Clicking on a word also shows dictionary
    entries that are very close in Levenshtein distance, but for more than
    three results the widget at the bottom of the page must be used.</li>
<li>Verbs are conjugated by infixing against a pronoun table that solvers
    probably don't have memorized. It can be helpful to pull these pronouns out
    in a partial translation so that you don't have to think about them anymore.
    Knowing that verbs always end in consonants can save solvers from doing this
    unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Writing out the sentences in English word order (or other more familiar
    language of your choice) can help clarify the relationships of the words to
    each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the morphemes provided in the Crash Course, solvers should find
the following ones from given words and context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hen- and am-:</strong> Roughly "in-" and "out-/ex-". <code>henqos</code> "inside" is used
    constantly throughout the puzzle, contrasting with a couple instances of
    <code>amqos</code> "outside" and <code>defiqos</code> "left-side". In addition, the <code>dare</code>
    definition block gives <code>henhiaden</code> "they-inhale" and <code>amhiaden</code>
    "they-exhale".</li>
<li><strong>-gia:</strong> Roughly "-ine" or "-ide" or "-ate", denoting a chemical compound.
    The definition blocks for target words 1 and 3 contain references to
    chemical reactions with sodium compounds, and the <code>dare</code> block mentions
    "carbon <code>fe'avugia</code>".</li>
<li><strong>-enx-:</strong> "Water", notably in given words <code>enxura</code> "water+R" and
    <code>enxaq</code> "to submerge". A few other relatives appear in places where a
    water-thing makes sense.</li>
<li><strong>zam-:</strong> Roughly "salt", appearing in given words <code>zampaliso</code> "cheese"
    and <code>zamgomu</code> "tomato", from <code>zalma</code> "salt".</li>
<li><strong>og-:</strong> Denotes many of something, from <code>ogi</code> "many". Among the given
    words are <code>oghie</code> "popular" (many people) and <code>ogviqe</code> "majority" (many
    part).</li>
<li><strong>-tu:</strong> Roughly "-ish", as in the language suffix. The word onto which
    <code>-tu</code> is appended is the phonetically imported name of the language in that
    language; for example <code>iglextu</code> from "English", or <code>jogwuntu</code> from "zhong1
    wen2".</li>
<li><strong>-quna and -qeyuna:</strong> Literal words for "-having" and "-not-having". The
    latter is described explicitly in the <code>ityeriqeyuna</code> definition block.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also make frequent use of the fluid noun class, which is employed whenever
the head of a noun phrase is a fluid. In the annotations below, we denote this
as "+R".</p>
<h1>Known Words</h1>
<p>We start by trying to figure out the definition blocks for the non-target words.
These blocks can all be resolved mostly independently of one another assuming
very strong intuition on solvers' part; in practice some cross-referencing and
grammatical trial and error is required.</p>
<p>We present these below with the full Puflantu text first; followed by that text
with all known words replaced and inflections separated out; followed by a
rereading of that text with a roughly correct English word ordering.</p>
<h2>amwen (to surround, to envelop)</h2>
<pre><code>Albwr swma, rai swma amwaten-kas, utaru swma feru-ro axwe benwe amqos zatif-li,
feru utaru henqos zatif.
</code></pre>
<p>When thing, other thing it-<code>amwen</code>s, first thing second's all sides outside
it-is-located and, second first inside it-is-located.</p>
<p>When a thing <code>amwen</code>s another thing, the first thing is outside all the
second's sides, and the second is inside the first.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The intended translation of the unknown word is "to surround" or "to envelop" or
"to wrap". ("To cover" is a reasonable try but it already exists in the
dictionary as <code>urmez</code>.)</p>
<h2>besolafe (singer)</h2>
<pre><code>Uta besolafe, pelipa zoves tacalwl-ka hie zat. Edo Xiranu-li Teilo Swifu-li
Sa-naseksu, oghiwe lahrogbwe besolafwe zad.
</code></pre>
<p>One <code>besolafe</code>, specific way that-speaks person it-is. <code>Edo Xiranu</code>-and
<code>Teilo Swifu</code>-and <code>Sa-Naseksu</code>, popular Earth <code>besolafwe</code> they-are.</p>
<p>A <code>besolafe</code> is a person that speaks in a specific way. Ed Sheeran and Taylor
Swift and Diminutive Nas X are popular Earth <code>besolafwe</code>.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The celebrity names are mostly phonetically imported, including an abuse of the
diminutive <code>sa-</code> prefix seen in various places and described in the Crash
Course. The <code>-afe</code> suffix suggests that this is a kind of person that does
something; the particular celebrities chosen suggests that this is a singer (and
by extension, <code>besol</code> "to sing").</p>
<h2>casu (dust, powder)</h2>
<pre><code>Albwr swma, ageywe viqwe eg mohotur-li losmotod-kas, iqwe viqwe &quot;casu&quot; zad.
Tizov casu rizwe tamwe-tis fel jatif, mida fel merizeyin.

<p>When thing, very-small parts resultingly it-is-flattened-and it-is-<code>losmod</code>ed,
those parts "<code>casu</code>" they-are. This-way <code>casu</code> your eyes-at it-might-exist,

<p>When a thing is flattened and <code>losmod</code>ed into small pieces, those parts are
<code>casu</code>. If <code>casu</code> is on your eyes, you might not be able to see.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>There are a variety of options for verb <code>losmod</code> here &#x2013; "to grind", "to
crush", "to break" and so forth. (Existing word <code>losmodafe</code> "claw" doesn't
really narrow things down here.) However <code>casu</code> is reasonably guessed as "sand",
"powder", "dust", or something similar, based on its description as an eye
irritant made of very small parts.</p>
<h2>dare (plant, flora)</h2>
<pre><code>Uta dare, wrisa swma zat. Lahrogbi-tis, colbawe pahilamwe ogwris qadun, alzov
utqunxe-ro ittiha wladoc. Wrifuli fe'avugia henhiaden-li e'avuli amhiaden. Ratwe darvaxwe-cws

</code></pre>
<p>One <code>dare</code>, living thing it-is. Earth-at, green <code>pahilamwe</code> commonly
they-have, that-way sun+T's light+T they-eat. Carbon <code>fe'avugia</code>
they-inhale-and oxygen they-exhale. Its <code>darvax*</code>s-from water+R it-drinks.</p>
<p>A <code>dare</code> is (a) living thing. On Earth, they often have green <code>pahilam*</code>s, in
order to eat sunlight. They inhale carbon <code>fe'avugia</code>, and exhale oxygen. It
drinks water from their <code>darvax*</code>s.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>From context it is reasonable to infer <code>dare</code> as "plant", "tree", "grass",
"algae", or some other kind of flora. <code>Pahilam*</code> looks like it should be
"leaf" unless "green <code>pahilam*</code>" is "chlorophyll". <code>Fe'avugia</code> is clearly
"dioxide" from context, and a careful dissection of the word shows <code>fe</code> "two"
and <code>e'avu(li)</code> "oxygen". At this point it may still be unclear what <code>-gia</code>
is. <code>Darvax*</code> should be "root", also from context; solvers may be able to see
<code>dare</code> "plant" and <code>vax-</code> "below, under, bottom".</p>
<h2>eyozzove (flavor, taste)</h2>
<pre><code>Locho-ro eyozzove, zove motap, albwr eqa locho wlotoc-kas. Zalma-vo twipe-vo
zamkuraxwe ogwris piodwv, tizov eyozzovwe omafadodil-kas.
</code></pre>
<p>Food's <code>eyozzove</code>, way it-is-felt, when that food it-is-eaten. Salt-or
sugar-or <code>zamkuraxwe</code> commonly they-are-used, this-way <code>eyozzove</code>s
they-<code>omafil</code>-them.</p>
<p>A food's <code>eyozzove</code> is how it feels when that food is eaten. Salt, sugar, or
<code>zamkurax*</code>s are commonly used because they <code>omafil</code> <code>eyozzove</code>s.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>From the first sentence this should be "taste" or "flavor". Finding given word
<code>eyos</code> "to taste" is a decent confirmation that this is in the right directly;
some solvers may notice <code>eyos</code> "to taste" + <code>zove</code> "way, manner". It might
not be clear what <code>zamkurax*</code> is. Knowing <code>eyozzove</code> is "flavor",
<code>omafil</code> looks like "to improve" or "to enhance", which can be confirmed as a
verbification of given word <code>oma'fi</code> "better".</p>
<h2>hengoro (source, origin)</h2>
<pre><code>Swma-ro &quot;hengoro&quot;, hanu-fo bwri-fo rai zat, utaru swma ol-cws capatil-ka.
Puflantu-ro hengoro 13202 pazulu-li 13203 pazulliqexu zat.
</code></pre>
<p>Thing's <code>hengoro</code>, place-or time-or other it-is, first thing that-from
it-comes. Puflantu's <code>hengoro</code> 2018 puzzle-and 2019 puzzlehunt it-is.</p>
<p>A thing's <code>hengoro</code> is a place or time or other thing from which the first
thing comes. Puflantu's <code>hengoro</code> is a 2018 puzzle and a 2019 puzzlehunt.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>Reasonable guesses here are things like "birth(place/time)", "origin", or
"source". Exact interpretation of the second sentence requires knowledge that
Puflantu communicates in base 6, but just knowing that it's a construct from a
previous year is good enough to check the sense of <code>hengoro</code>.</p>
<h2>ityerqeyuni (colorless)</h2>
<pre><code>Swma &quot;ityerqeyuni&quot; zat, tidul ityeri qateyun-kas (o.c. ityeri qeyuna zat).
Swtabxaywe swmwe, &quot;apo&quot;-fo &quot;wre&quot; jok gamas ogviqes sinqwyoder.
</code></pre>
<p>Thing <code>ityerqeyuni</code> it-is, this-reason color it-does-not-possess (<code>o.c.</code>
color not-having it-is). Not-transparent things, "white"-or "black" as instead
mostly we-describe-them.</p>
<p>A thing is <code>ityerqeyuni</code> if it doesn't have color (<code>o.c.</code> it is
color-lacking). We mostly describe non-transparent things as being white or
black instead.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The text pretty much spells out the etymology here for "colorless". In
particular we take note of the <code>-qeyuna</code> suffix as being a thing, and might
guess that the corresponding <code>-quna</code> suffix also works to indicate that
something is present (perhaps like English "-less" and "-ful" respectively).</p>
<h2>jwntatimoru (counterpart, partner)</h2>
<pre><code>Swma rato &quot;jwntatimoru&quot; atimator, rai hanu-fo rai bwri henqos. Albwr swmw jwntu
henqos jabif, ab urarai-ro &quot;jwntatimorw&quot; zab.
</code></pre>
<p>Thing its <code>jwntatimoru</code> it-matches, other place-or other time within. When
two-things pair within they-exist, they-two each-other's <code>jwntatimoru</code>s
they-are.</p>
<p>A thing matches its <code>jwntatimoru</code> in another place or time. When two things are
paired, they are each other's <code>jwntatimoru</code>.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The text suggests "partner" or "counterpart". Some solvers may notice <code>jwntu</code>
"pair" and <code>atimor</code> "to match" in the dictionary.</p>
<h2>kaxo (fluid, liquid)</h2>
<pre><code>Swma &quot;kaxo&quot; zat, tidul rato velbena binpateyan (r.c. radokodqeyuna zat) -li
ovekqus esator-kas. Albwr orvuro kaxro-bes tacwywl-kas, &quot;r&quot; feru awbe defiqos

</code></pre>
<p>Thing <code>kaxo</code> it-is, this-reason its shape it-does-not-continue (r.c.
<code>radokodqeyuna</code> it-is) -and easily <code>esator</code>. When some <code>kaxo</code>-<code>bes</code> we-speak,
"r" second <code>awbe</code> <code>defiqos</code> we-add.</p>
<p>A thing is <code>kaxo</code> if its shape does not stay (<code>r.c.</code> it is <code>radokodqeyuna</code>) and
it easily <code>esor</code>s (or <code>esaor</code>s). When we speak <code>bes</code> some <code>kaxo</code>, we add "r" <code>defiqos</code> second
<code>awbe</code>.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>If you have the suffix <code>-qeyuna</code> "-less" from <code>ityerqeyuni</code> "colorless", you can
translate <code>radokodqeyuna</code> as "formless" or "shapeless". (See Target 5 about the
vowels.)</p>
<p>The second sentence strongly recalls instructions about the -r- infix described
in the Crash Course (or maybe you just remembered it from 2019). That and the
first sentence confirm <code>kaxo</code> "liquid" or "fluid", <code>esor</code> "to change" or maybe
"to deform", and <code>awbe</code> as "vowel". <code>Bes</code> is written like one of our small
prepositions and from context can only really be "about". <code>Defiqos</code> matches with
given word <code>defisa</code> "left-side" and <code>henqos</code> "within/inward" as "leftward".</p>
<h2>kombwqa (kombucha)</h2>
<pre><code>Ita sazixro teri riqhuro zat. Aguyri e'ranxagia qatun. Twripe teri-li

<p>This is a <code>sazixro</code> <code>teri</code> beverage. It has very little <code>e'ranxagia</code>. It is made
from combining sugary <code>teri</code> and <code>sazwms*</code>s and yeast. Some people think that
it is medicine. (Danger: If you ask a <code>nihogotu</code> speaker this-<code>bes</code>, they will
give to you a different beverage.)</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>Pronouncing the word out loud should put solvers in mind of the drink
"kombucha", whose word is imported directly. The list of ingredients for
kombucha includes a "symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast" (so commonly
worded in this fashion that its acronym is understood), so <code>sazwmswe</code> must be
"bacteria" and the sweet liquid must be <code>tei</code> "tea" (after taking out the +R
transformation). Etymologically "kombucha" is noted for being an incorrectly
imported word from <code>nihogotu</code> "Japanese" (via "nihongo"), wherein it refers to a
non-fermented kelp tea. <code>Bes</code> could be "for" or "about", or some other object
indicator.</p>
<p>Of the remaining words we have <code>sazixro</code> or slightly <code>zixo</code>+R as a
characteristic of kombucha; and <code>e'anxagia</code>+R which is present in some small
quantity. Other characteristics of kombucha that might come to mind are
"probiotic", "fizzy", "acidic", "antioxidant", and maybe "healthy" (depending on
what blogs you read). Solvers might be able to get <code>e'anxagia</code> "alcohol" as
<code>e'a</code> "fire" + <code>enxa</code> "water" + <code>-gia</code> "chemical".</p>
<p><span class="aside"><code>Sazwmsi</code> "bacterium", lit. "diminutive fish", was chosen in
parallel with "bacterium", lit. "diminutive staff/rod", the idea being that one
names them after whatever they look like when they're spotted under a microscope
for the first time. <code>Tei</code> "tea" was chosen based on human languages picking "t<em>"
or "ch</em>" ("q*") depending on whether their first exposure traces back to Britian
faster than to China.</span></p>
<h2>lwgoro (substance, material)</h2>
<pre><code>Uta lwgoro swma eji zat. Rawe ot-cws qukwmi aza meradin. Nagtice-li enxura-li

<p>A <code>lwgoro</code> is a type of thing. Other things can be produced from it.
<code>Nagtice</code> and water and silver are <code>lwgoro</code>s; shoe and person and asteroid
are not.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>From the description we can guess something like "element", "material",
"matter", "substance", or "resource" for <code>lwgoro</code>. We can't really infer
anything about <code>nagtice</code> here but it has its own definition block later.</p>
<h2>mapoca</h2>
<p>We'll skip this one for now.</p>
<h2>nagtice (paper)</h2>
<pre><code>Nagtice, pahilame lwgoro zat, nathwe ol-bedfis ajena merizin-ka. Ogwe nagticwe
jiay xifwmi aza meradin, kude eg.
</code></pre>
<p><code>Nagtice</code>, <code>pahilame</code> <code>lwgoro</code> it-is, words it-atop putting you-can. Many
<code>nagtice</code>s together <code>xifwmi</code> being they-can-be, book resultingly.</p>
<p><code>Nagtice</code> is a <code>pahilame</code> <code>lwgoro</code>, which you can put words on. Many
<code>nagtice</code>s can be together <code>xifwmi</code> resulting in a book.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>This doesn't give much to work with for the other words, but assuming that we're
talking about a physical thing the second sentence implies <code>nagtice</code> is
"paper", even if we're not sure what <code>xifwmi</code> is. A dictionary search yields
<code>xifafe</code> "knot", so a reasonable guess is <code>xif</code> as "bind" or "tie" and
<code>xifwmi</code> as "bound" or "tied". (<code>xif</code> "twist" might also be a candidate but
there aren't many things that can be said to make a book after being twisted
together.)</p>
<h2>ogerok (to shred)</h2>
<pre><code>Albwr swma ogerotok-kas, ogwe viqwe etataz. Zampaliso-li nagtice ogerokwmi aza

<p>When thing it-is-<code>ogerok</code>ed, many parts it-becomes. Cheese-and <code>nagtice</code>
<code>ogerok</code>ed being they-can.</p>
<p>When a thing is <code>ogerok</code>ed, it turns into many parts. Cheese and <code>nagtice</code>
can be <code>ogerok</code>ed.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>There are a lot of transformative words that can fit here, but if we restrict
ourselves to ones that can be applied to cheese we have mostly culinary ones
like "to slice", "to grind", "to blend", "to grate", and so forth (as opposed to
"to shatter" or "to disassemble"). If we have <code>nagtice</code> "paper" this is
narrowed down to options like "to pulp" (as for papier mache) or "to shred".</p>
<h2>ogviqe (majority, most (proportion))</h2>
<pre><code>Swma-ro &quot;ogviqe&quot;, rato agi' viqe zat. Iqa natho, uta tola zove karkas nagtatal,

<p>A thing's majority is its biggest part. That word also names a selection method
which some societies use.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>This block is already translated in its entirety, but it does give solvers an
extra way to check their grammar. In addition it shows the words <code>viqe</code> "part"
and <code>nagtal</code> "to name", which solvers will encounter other conjugations for in
the rest of the puzzle. None of the other conjugations of "to name" are
automatically translated, so solvers will have to enter in <code>nagtwyotal</code>
"we-name-it" or <code>nagtotal</code> "it-is-named" as they are encountered.</p>
<h2>ovekqipiwvu (convenient)</h2>
<pre><code>Albwr piotwv-kas, ovekqipiwvu swma, ovekqipiwvayu swma jifated-sos, uyi'fi bahu
jifated. Albwr hie forovwe dokfe natib-kas, qacepo ovekqipiwvu'fi zat, zagtivo

<p>When it is used, a thing that is <code>ovekqipiwvu</code> <code>jifed</code>s less trouble than one
that is not. When a person moves between planets, a spaceship is more
<code>ovekqipiwvu</code> than an asteroid.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The second sentence and the similarity to <code>ovekqu</code> "easy" suggests options
like "expedient", "efficient", or "comfortable" (the latter helping to rule out
things like "reliable", "safe", "legal", or "acceptable"). Context gives us
<code>jifed</code> as "to incur", "to encounter", or "to create".</p>
<h2>twipelame (candy)</h2>
<pre><code>Ogwe hiwe somalodun-ka twipe locho eji zat. Ogwe twipelamwe, rotwipe-vo gomu

</code></pre>
<p>Many people that-pleases-them sugar food type it-is. Many <code>twipelame</code>s,

<p>It is a sweet food type that many people like. Many <code>twipelame</code>s have
chocolate or fruit <code>eyozzove</code>.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The cluing gives us <code>twipelame</code> candidates like "confection", "dessert",
"cake", "pastry", "candy", and so forth.</p>
<h2>vaxtipu (bedrock, foundation)</h2>
<pre><code>Onamgenas, &quot;vaxtipu&quot; atipu eji zat, ol zoan niba agovekqayu zat. Vaxtipu,

other things they-are-<code>amrad</code>ed.</p>
<p><code>Onamgenas</code>, <code>vaxtipu</code> is a rock type that is difficult to move through. It
is located below softer things. <code>Cobargenes</code>, other things are <code>amrad</code>ed on
top of it.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>From <code>vax-</code> "bottom" and <code>atipu</code> "rock" we guess <code>vaxtipu</code> as "bedrock", though
the rest of the definition is a bit awkward. <code>Amrad</code> is likely some kind of
placement verb, and a dictionary search yields <code>amradoda</code> "building", so <code>amrad</code>
is probably "to build" or "to construct".</p>
<p><code>Onamgenas</code> and <code>cobargenes</code> should be interpreted as two contrasting senses for
a word; in particular, <code>onamgenas</code> appears frequently elsewhere in the puzzle in
the context of a word indicating something. A dictionary search gives <code>onama</code>
"equal", <code>cobare</code> "poem", and <code>gen</code> "to read"; solvers are intended to infer
<code>onamgenas</code> "literally" and <code>cobargenes</code> "metaphorically" or "figuratively".</p>
<h2>yirwhanu (subject, topic)</h2>
<pre><code>Uta yirwhanu, yirwho wndatolak-ka swma zat. (Iqa yirwho eqa yirwhanu-bes zat.)

<p>A <code>yirwhanu</code> is a thing that an idea refers to. (That idea is <code>yirwhanu</code>-<code>bes</code>.)
It is also a thing-<code>bes</code> you learn at school or a thing-<code>bes</code> books are written.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The first sentence suggests something abstract like "concept", "knowledge",
"subject", "topic", "information", which is somehow learnable and writable. If we
didn't already have it from the single example in the <code>kaxo</code> definition block,
the use of <code>bes</code> here also cues "about".</p>
<h2>zovgire (science)</h2>
<pre><code>Zovgire, puflantu lifwyan-ka durema zove zat. Swmwe mida-li zovgire dokfe

<code>Amjuyunwe</code> also sometimes it-makes.</p>
<p><code>Zovgire</code> is a sequential way that we study Puflantu. The difference between
<code>zovgire</code> and doing random things is writing things that-were-seen-<code>bes</code>. It
also sometimes makes <code>amjuyunwe</code>.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The first sentence requires a reading of "Puflantu" as also meaning "galaxy" (or
"galactic"); thus <code>zovgire</code> might be some field of study like "astronomy". The
second sentence doesn't work with any particular subject, but it recalls an Adam
Savage quote about the difference between "science" and screwing around.
<code>Amjuyun*</code> could be a variety of things even if we identify its components as
<code>am-</code> "outward" and <code>juyun(a?)</code> "break(ing?)" &#x2013; "discovery", "mistake",
and "explosion" among them.</p>
<h1>Target Words</h1>
<p>Up to this point none of the entries depend particularly much on one another.
The most effective thing a solver can do is to carefully parse the grammar. We
still have one given word &#x2013; <code>mapoca</code> &#x2013; and the eight targets for
actually solving the puzzle.</p>
<p>In general, solvers should notice after a few successful translations that each
of these blocks ends in a statement or two about a human etymology for the item,
and a statement about the Puflantu etymology for the item. The morphemes
required by the Puflantu etymology can only be found in other target blocks.</p>
<p>To resolve many of the unknown words, a lookup of an Earth etymology for the
target is very helpful. The intended flow is that the first sentence or two
allow solvers to identify the item being described; the etymology of that item's
name then helps identify words that get used by other targets.</p>
<h2>Target 1</h2>
<pre><code>Ita ajorgia hengoro zat. Orvwe hiwe fwmta wladeyoc, aldul eta fel wladoc. Ogwris

<code>nagta</code> also we-<code>henfaz</code>-but, when we-say-it, its color firstly we-refer-to.</p>
<p>This is (a) <code>ajorgia</code> origin(?). Some people do not eat <code>fwmta</code>, so they
might eat this. It is commonly shown as cubes or strips or <code>pahilam*</code>s. Its
<code>nagta</code> indicates "<code>qovo</code> <code>fasiba</code>" in <code>jogwuntu</code>. Most <code>nagutaq*</code>s
simply <code>henfaz</code> its word. We also <code>henfaz</code> its <code>nagta</code>, but when we say
it, we refer to its color first.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>Solvers are intended to guess <code>fwmta</code> as "meat", the most common human dietary
restriction. This also gives the first sentence of <code>mapoca</code>'s definition as
"This is where you keep your thinker <strong>meat</strong>.", which is a colorful way to say
"brain". Many of the things people specifically add to their diets to compensate
for the lack of meat are <code>hengoro</code> "source"s of <code>ajorgia</code> "protein", choosing to
finally resolve <code>hengoro</code> as "source" among our various choices for "a thing
that something else comes from".</p>
<p>The popular candidates for the thing we're describing &#x2013; seitan, tempeh,
and tofu &#x2013; can all be found in cube or strip form. (If there were
powder-based protein supplements in contention, like whey, they should be
eliminated by this statement about form factor.) A <code>pahilam*</code> is something
such that a plant has green <code>pahilam*</code> and paper is a <code>pahilam*</code> thing
(element, material, resource, etc.) so it may be reasonable to now infer that
<code>pahilam*</code> refers to any flat thing, like a leaf or a sheet. This weighs our
choice somewhat in favor of "tofu", as seitan and tempeh are not often sold in
that shape (based on a cursory Google search).</p>
<p>Putting that aside, we have that its <code>nagta</code> indicates ("means") something in
<code>jogwuntu</code>. If we haven't already figured out <code>nagta</code>, we can see from this
paragraph that it is something that can be <code>henfaz</code>ed by a <code>nagutaq*</code> and
also by whatever group the writer is affiliated with, and is a synonym for
"word". This context points to <code>nagta</code> "name". Pattern matching to other
paragraphs or just saying things out loud will also lead solvers to <code>jogwuntu</code>
"Chinese" (via "zhong1 wen2"). "Seitan" is of Japanese origin, and "tempeh" is
from Indonesian, so this paragraph is probably talking about "tofu", whose name
comes from the Chinese for <code>qovo</code> "bean" <code>fasiba</code> "decaying" (lit. "rot").
(Word order may be questionable here but one of the two words looks like a verb
with -a on the end, and there isn't really an obvious verb associated with
"bean".)</p>
<p><code>Henfaz</code> is something that can be done to a word, and in fact has been done to
"tofu" by a majority of <code>nagutaq*</code>s. Solvers must deduce that this is <code>hen-</code>
"inward" + <code>faz</code> "to take", i.e. "to take in" or "to import"; in context this
makes <code>nagutaq*</code> "language", a thing that imports words. Puflantu also imports
the word but names its color first. Tofu is commonly <code>apo</code> "white", so the
Puflantu word is APO[T]OFU. (The W sound is more accurate to the source but
Puflantu has a rule against ending nouns with -w because it uses that for its
dual number.)</p>
<h2>mapoca (head)</h2>
<pre><code>Rizo tixmapafe fwmta tihan mwizen. Rizo ajore-ro bedfis zifa ogfatel-li uta-li

<p>You hold your thinker meat here. It is probably on top of your <code>ajore</code> and has
between one and six eyes. (If you are human, that it has two eyes is likely.)</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>"Thinker meat" is just a weird way to say "brain", so this paragraph clues a
<code>mapoca</code> "head" (lit. feel-box). <code>Ajore</code> could be "neck", "torso", or
"body"; if we have <code>ajorgia</code> "protein" from Target 1 we can infer "body", with

<p>It is a clear, colorless fluid. Spice <code>zamkurax*</code>s and mixed plants
<code>zamkurax*</code> use it as bedrock. Because it is <code>zixo</code>, it fights with sodium
<code>fewlifugia</code>. Thus it is used in one easy science showing, which results in
<code>e'adendi</code> <code>amjuyuna</code> <code>ywrmidi</code>. In <code>furansetu</code>, its <code>nagta</code> refers to
a specific <code>e'anxagia</code> type that has become <code>gevaxe</code>. We refer to the same
alcohol type, but we describe it as "<code>vorulfob</code>ed by bacteria".</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>It is necessary to first observe that many of the words in the first couple
sentences (marked with <code>+R</code>) are in the r-adding fluid noun class, which is why
we have <code>ityurerqeyuni</code> instead of the <code>ityerqeyuni</code> we already translated
as "colorless". With that in mind, looking at the declined and pluralized
versions of <code>saro</code> "spice" and <code>dare</code> "plant", we conclude that the first
unknown word here is actually <code>zamkaxo</code>. We also know from the <code>eyozzove</code>
definition block that this is a food additive like salt or sugar that does
something to flavor. We can pick a fluid in this category like "oil" or "gravy".
Realizing that "mixed plants" refers to "salad" also suggests "dressing".</p>
<p>Whatever this is has a property <code>zixo</code>, which causes it to fight (more likely
"react") with a sodium compound, and this reaction is used in a science showing
(more likely "demonstration"). Translating these sentences requires one to take
apart the unknown words; getting either of the first two helps a lot with the
others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recalling <code>fe'avugia</code> "dioxide" from the <code>dare</code> definition block, we see
  <code>fewlifugia</code> as <code>fe</code> "two" plus <code>wlif(uli)</code> "carbon" plus <code>-gia</code> "chemical".
  Along with "sodium" this suggests <code>fewlifugia</code> as "bicarbonate".</li>
<li><code>e'a</code> and <code>dendi</code> appear directly in the dictionary as "fire" and "mountain"
  respectively, giving <code>e'adendi</code> "volcano".</li>
<li>We saw <code>amjuyuna</code> in the <code>zovgire</code> definition block. Its presence in the
  context of a science demonstration means that it's something that can happen
  intentionally, so probably "bursting" or "explosion" and less likely
  "discovery". (If we got "volcano" then "explosion" as a close synonym of
  "eruption" seems like the pick.)</li>
<li><code>ywrmidi</code> is intended as "illusion" or "simulation", after <code>ywri</code> "false" and
  <code>mida</code> "seeing/sight".</li>
</ul>
<p>The unnamed compound in this reaction is "vinegar", which is a clear, colorless
fluid that can be used as a <code>vaxtipu</code> "bedrock (foundation)" for <code>zamkaro</code>s
"dressings/sauces". It reacts with sodium bicarbonate because it is <code>zixo</code>
"acid(ic)". We can also cross reference this with the list of properties that
might be <code>sazixro</code> "slightly <code>zixo</code>"+R in <code>kombwqa</code>; a thing that vinegar is
that kombucha slightly is, is acidic.</p>
<p><code>Furansetu</code> is something that has vinegar's <code>nagta</code> in it. Saying the word
out loud, and perhaps cross-referencing with the structure of other clues,
suggests <code>furansetu</code> "French" (from import of "francais"). Having <code>nagtal</code>
"to name" from the <code>ogviqe</code> definition block (and the repetition of <code>nagta</code>
and <code>nagtal</code> in other definition blocks) gives <code>nagta</code> "name".</p>
<p>French <code>vinaigre</code>, which is also the source of the English word, means "sour
wine", so wine is our specific <code>e'anxagia</code> type with <code>e'anxagia</code> as
fire-water-chemical or "alcohol", and it has become <code>gevaxe</code> "sour".</p>
<p>The Puflantu etymology requires something meaning <code>vorulfob</code>. This is <code>vo-</code>
"inverted" and <code>rulfob</code> "combine", so this word is something like "(very)
disassembled". It is done by <code>sazwmswe</code> "bacteria", which we got from the
<code>kombwqa</code> clue. As with the process referred to by French's "acrid wine", this
is referring to allowing wine to ferment further. Finding <code>fasib</code> "to decay" in
the descriptions of Target 1 or Target 8 suggests the word for vinegar is
FA[S]IBWMI TINI, lit. "decayed wine".</p>

<p>When this <code>lwgoro</code> is <code>enxal</code>ed and added to milk, that milk <code>vokarur</code>s
into cheese. Its sand(?) or <code>velbenatipu</code> form covers some desserts(?). In
water, this and sodium <code>fewlifugia</code> make sodium <code>gevaxegia</code> and bubbles. Its
sand(?) is sometimes <code>vokanwj</code>ed as a type of salt. Most <code>nagutaq*</code>s name
it from a specific fruit or family of fruits. The fruit we refer to is named for
its flavor.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>We first decipher <code>vokarur</code> as the inverse (<code>vo-</code>) of <code>karur</code> "to melt", i.e.
<code>vokarur</code> "to solidify". There are a variety of things that can be said to
produce this reaction: acids, various bacteria/mold cultures, and rennet.
Whatever it is, it first has to be <code>enxal</code>-ed "hydrated, dissolved in water"
(from <code>enxa</code> "water"), which rules out the ingredients that are inherently
liquid. It can also go directly onto some sweet foods in powder form, which
rules out the cultures and rennet. <code>Velbenatipu</code> "crystal" (lit. shape-rock)
doesn't really give us any new information but might be helpful if we didn't
land on a solid translation for <code>casu</code> "sand/dust/powder". We expect that
solvers have at this time narrowed the field of choices to an acid of some kind;
the common ones used in cheesemaking are vinegar, lemon juice, and citric acid.</p>
<p>The decomposition of <code>fewlifugia</code> "bicarbonate" is described in the walkthrough
for Target 1, which can be done here independent of having identified that item.
Unfortunately this doesn't really rule out any acid. Choosing vinegar leads us
to <code>gevaxegia</code> as "acetate", while lemon juice or citric acid lead us to
<code>gevaxegia</code> as "citrate".</p>
<p><code>Vokanwj</code> is the inverse (<code>vo-</code>) of <code>kanwj</code> "to buy", so it means "to sell". As
before, vinegar doesn't really have a powder form. Between lemon juice and
citric acid, citric acid is sold as "sour salt".</p>
<p><code>Nagutaq*</code> from this clue is something that can name something else. This
doesn't really give an identification on its own but might help in conjunction
with the context provided by some of the other clues. Once you know that it is
"language", we can check that Earth's major languages all name citric acid after
the citrus family, or the citron itself, or the lemon. Puflantu names it in the
same way, referring to a fruit that is named for its taste. A search of the
dictionary shows that Puflantu fruits all end in <code>-gomu</code>, which is also the word
for "fruit" on its own; so we are looking for GEVAXEG[O]MU ZIXO, with <code>gevaxe</code>
"sour" and <code>zixo</code> acid both coming from Target 1.</p>
<p>If we still believe that this paragraph describes lemon juice (because
admittedly it is very hard to subtly distinguish between the two), we get
GEVAXEG[O]MU GEZE instead, which extracts the same letter (but won't be accepted
by the checker). <code>Geze</code> "juice" is given in the dictionary.</p>

<p>This is a food <code>dubqajena</code> type where <code>malo</code> surrounds(?) some foods. That
<code>malo</code> is on the top and bottom. If <code>malo</code> exists on other sides, does that
food still belong? It is a popular <code>ji'satacwla</code> concept. This food type,
because it is comfortable(?), was liked by an Earth noble. Many Earth
<code>nagutaq*</code>s name this from that royal's land. Our word for it <code>onamgenas</code>
indicates "a shape made from a common <code>malo</code>".</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>A dictionary search gives <code>dubqa</code> "intentional" + <code>ajena</code> "placement" for
<code>dubqajena</code> "arrangement".</p>
<p>The next few sentences are about some <code>malo</code> thing and its placement in the
food arrangement. The question of <code>malo</code> being on varying sides of a thing,
but always on the top and bottom, recalls the ever-popular "Is it a sandwich?"
question. This suggests <code>ji'sagtacwla</code> "debate" or "argument" from <code>ji'sag</code>
"fight" and <code>tacwl</code> "speak", and <code>malo</code> as "dough" or "starch" (the
dictionary already has <code>kolarvu</code> "bread").</p>
<p>The next couple sentences refer to this thing being named from the lands owned
by an Earth noble, referring to the Earl of Sandwich, who is attested as the
source of the word. If we are still unsure about <code>ovekqipiwvu</code> from its
paragraph we can guess "convenient" or something similar from this context.</p>
<p>The final sentence says that the Puflantu word is like a shape made from a
common <code>malo</code> for this food type. Looking through some shapes in the
dictionary suggests <code>-bena</code> as their common suffix. The most common substance
that occurs on the sides of a sandwich is <code>kolarvu</code> "bread", which gives the
translation KOLARVUB[E]NA for "sandwich".</p>

<code>Eqmeyossa</code>" but is beaten by creatures <code>nagtal</code>ed "Paper <code>Jalqunu</code>". Its word
in some <code>iglextwe</code> versions refers to another creature, but they do not belong
in the same family. The biggest difference between them is that one creature has
big hands that the other lacks. The Puflantu word for it refers to (the fact
that) these <code>ajorwe</code> parts don't exist.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The first couple sentences reference the opening of GPH theme song Rock Lobster,
so we pick up:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are probably looking for the word for "rock lobster".</li>
<li><code>yirwhanu</code> now has to be something that the "rock lobster" is for the song
    "Rock Lobster", so it's probably "subject" or "topic" rather than
    "information" or "knowledge".</li>
<li>There are a few lines which can match up with the end of the second
    sentence. It doesn't contain two verbs for "to reach" and "to grab", and it
    doesn't contain the known words for "to go" or "to see", so it should
    be "someone's earlobe fell in the deep". So we have <code>oniglame</code> "earlobe",
    <code>vaxuso</code> "deep" (noting <code>vax-</code> "bottom"), and <code>rek</code> "to fall".</li>
</ul>
<p>A search for "rock lobster card game" finds that Magic: The Gathering has such a
card that participates in a rock-paper-scissors cycle with two others, so:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nagtal</code> is probably "to call" or "to name", taking a cue from the Magic
    phrasing which specifies things about "creatures named X".</li>
<li>The word after Paper is <code>jalqunu</code> "tiger"; a dictionary search finds <code>jalu</code>
    "strip" and <code>qun</code> "to possess", so tiger is "strip-having", with the suffix
    in contrast with <code>ityerqeyuni</code> "color-lacking".</li>
<li><code>jwnterokafu eqmeyossa</code> is likely "Scissors Lizard", and a dictionary search
    confirms this with <code>jwntu</code> "pair" (cf. <code>jwntatimoru</code>), <code>erok(afe)</code>
    "cut(ter)", <code>eqme</code> "leg" and <code>yossa</code> "snake".</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Iglextwe</code> requires a bit of a jump along with some pronunciation, but can be
guessed as "English (language)". Looking up the biology of rock lobsters shows
that they are not, in fact, lobsters, and are lacking their namesake's large
claws ("hands"). The last sentence tells us that the Puflantu word refers to
these claws being missing. We can find <code>losmodafe</code> "claw" in the dictionary, and
combine it with the -lacking suffix to get <code>LOSMO[D]AFQEYUNE</code>. In addition
<code>ajor*</code> must be defined such that a claw is an <code>ajor*</code> part, so we can
think about an adjective like "grabby" or "front", or just "body".</p>
<p>There is an unspecified rule here, which affects any two-part word whose first
part is noun- or adjective-like and whose second part is verb-derived: The last
vowel of the first word moves to the end of the second and replaces any vowel
there. If the vowel movement results in a three-consonant cluster in the middle
of the word, a copy of the first vowel of the second word is inserted before the
second word; thus <code>ityeri-qeyuna</code> --&gt; <code>ityer-qeyuni</code>. This also affects
<code>cobargene(s)</code>, <code>jalqunu</code>, <code>jwntatimoru</code>, <code>onamgena(s)</code>, <code>ovekqipiwvu</code>,
<code>zovgire</code>, and the construction of <code>losmodafqeyune</code>. It is not necessary to
determine this rule to solve the puzzle, since the resulting morphemes still
bear a lot of resemblance to their sources. One must only know that a vowel is
being omitted in the middle somehow, and the ending vowel for this word can be
brute-forced.</p>

<p>When flour is made from <code>kasava</code> <code>darvaxe</code>, this element(?) is a secondary
product. One popular beverage submerges small <code>rwtxovur*</code>s made from this in
<code>teri</code>, and sometimes milk or fruit is added. Its <code>nagta</code> comes from
<code>twpikwaranitu</code> words that indicate "left behind" and "flattening result". We
refer to it thus: Its <code>wrifenxagia</code> type (which is not sugar) and its <code>enxalwmi</code>
form, which <code>gagaz</code>s peanut butter's partner(?).</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>Solvers may recognize that cassava is a flour source and that <code>kasava</code> is a
likely import word as a result. The part of the cassava plant used for this is
the root, which matches well with <code>dare</code> "plant" + <code>vax-</code> "below, underneath",
so we can guess <code>darvaxe</code> as root. The material that is a by-product of cassava
flour production is tapioca.</p>
<p>The next sense describes a popular beverage that contains small <code>rwtxovur*</code>s of
the thing we're talking about. A search of the dictionary shows that <code>-vura</code> is
a common suffix for three dimensional shapes, e.g. <code>saqvura</code> "six-solid", which
is also used in Target 2. <code>Rwtxo</code> is circle, so we surmise <code>rwtxovura</code> "sphere".
A popular drink that contains small spheres and sometimes milk or fruit is
bubble tea (helped along if we got <code>tei</code>/<code>teri</code> from the <code>kombwqa</code> clue); the
boba are made from tapioca.</p>
<p>Checking the human etymology of "tapioca" shows that it is from Tupi-Guarani
words meaning "dregs" and "squeezed out", which matches with the next sentence.
The language name has been imported and gives credence to the idea of <code>-tu</code> as a
language-naming suffix. <code>Nagta</code>, as before, seems like a synonym of "word".</p>
<p>The final sentence explains the Puflantu etymology:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wrifenxagia</code> "carbohydrate", from <code>wrifuli</code> "carbon" + <code>enxa</code> "water" +
  <code>-gia</code> "chemical". To give a bit of an extra nudge, we specify that it is not
  sugar, so if we don't get it immediately we at least know that sugar is an
  <code>wrifenxagia</code> but it's not the one we're looking for.</li>
<li><code>enxalwmi</code> "hydrated" is the past participle of <code>enxal</code>, which itself is a
  verbification of "water". This word also appears at the beginning of Target 3.</li>
<li><code>gagaz</code> is something that hydrated tapioca can be relative to peanut butter's
  partner, cluing "jelly". We can find <code>gaga</code> "same, similar" in the dictionary;
  <code>gagaz</code> "resemble" is the word intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>A carbohydrate that is not sugar is <code>malo</code> "starch" from Target 4, and jelly is
<code>orbili</code>. Putting them together gives M[A]LORBILI.</p>

<p>Shredded or jellied, it accommpanies <code>fwmt*</code> dishes. It commonly
replaces one similar <code>satwlixafe</code>, which is eaten with fish that is not

partner(?). In some <code>italianatwe</code> versions, its word <code>onamgenas</code> indicates
"strong beard". We refer to it by its flavor(?) and the plant part that it is.</p>
<h3>Solve Path</h3>
<p>The word <code>satwlixafe</code> is <code>sa-</code> "diminutive" + <code>twlix</code> "to accompany" + <code>-afe</code>
"agent", so <code>satwlixafe</code> is a small accompaniment, presumably to food.
Reasonable candidates are "garnish", "condiment", or "side dish". Whatever it
is, our target replaces it in going with uncooked fish -- this could be sushi,
ceviche, some kind of tartare, or maybe oysters.</p>
<p>The two language clues are for <code>nihogotu</code> "Japanese" (from nihongo) and
<code>italianatwe</code> "Italian" (from italiana). The latter is probably easier to get
but will hopefully put solvers in the mind of looking for language names.</p>
<p>The Japanese clue refers to the same accompaniment being referred to in the
previous sentence, so we should consider things that go with sushi. Wasabi is a
small accompaniment that goes with sushi, which in many cases is replaced with
horseradish (at least, in the US). Indeed, the Japanese word for horseradish
means "western wasabi".</p>
<p>The Italian clue requires a translation of "strong beard" into Italian;
"barbaforte" is another name for horseradish.</p>
<p>The flavor of horseradish can be characterized by "sharp", "pungent", or
"spicy"; the closest thing we can find in the puzzle text is <code>saro</code> "spice" in
Target 2, used in the context of "spice sauces". The part of the horseradish
plant that gets eaten is the <code>darvaxe</code> root, given by Target 6 and the <code>dare</code>

<p>A compound in many beverages that prevents desire for sleep is caffeine, which
is also used to prevent headaches, hence <code>dwhoka</code> "pain" or "ache".</p>
<p>The thing in chocolate that defines its relationship to dogs is theobromine,
which is very similar to caffeine (it's missing a methyl group). This can help
us get <code>gagaz</code> "to resemble" and <code>yuriqo</code> "toxin" or "poison".</p>
<p>The common etymology for caffeine on Earth is that it gets named for coffee.
This helps confirm <code>qovo</code> "bean" against Target 1 if we didn't already have it,
and clues <code>losmod</code> as "crush" or "grind" if we recall it from Target 6 or its
use in the <code>casu</code> definition block.</p>
<p>The Puflantu etymology is of the same form (it "resembles earth languages'
words' configurations"), but they use a different beverage: tea, which is made
from leaves (see use of "sheets" in the <code>dare</code> definition block) that have been
<code>safasib</code> "slightly rotted", i.e. slightly fermented. <code>Tei</code> "tea" is provided by
Target 6 in the context of bubble tea, and by the <code>kombwqa</code> definition block. In
both those contexts it is referred to as a drink, so we have to remember to take
the +R transformation out instead of using <code>teri</code>. (In contrast, "tea leaf" is
<code>tei pahilame</code> because the leaf is not a fluid.) We add to this the common
this-is-a-chemical suffix <code>-gia</code> to get TEI[G]IA.</p>

<p>The words are provided in alphabetical order by Puflantu word; we use the
alphabetical ordering of their English translations instead to extract.</p>
