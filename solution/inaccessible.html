    <p>We can’t find our glasses to see this puzzle, but it’s a good thing we have a screen reader to help us! Listening to the screen reader audio, we notice that the puzzle consists of six images of creatures each next to a number. The screen-read flavortext about “the events this year”, the title of the puzzle (<em>Opening Ceremony</em>), and the timing of the hunt all hint at the Olympics, which start on the same day as this hunt. Additionally, both the Olympics and Galactic Puzzle Hunt are definitely taking place in 2020.</p>
<p>If we search for these creatures’ descriptions, we find that they are all mascots — not for the Olympics, but for the Paralympics, which always occur immediately after the Olympics for athletes with disabilities. (This is suggested by the accessibility theme of this actual puzzle, including the title, <em>Inaccessible</em>.)</p>
<p>Once we identify the Paralympic mascots, indexing into their names by their given numbers spells MARVEL. If we carefully listen to the details for each mascot, we notice that each mascot has an extra component (clued by “extra prepared” in the flavor). Combining these items gives the <a href="inaccessible/doctor-strange.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outfit</a> for <strong>DOCTOR STRANGE</strong>, a Marvel superhero matching the underscore enumeration (6 7) given at the end of the puzzle.</p>

<p><em>These familiar creatures all seem to be extra prepared for the events this year, but who can’t make it?</em></p>

<p>We both watch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aurateur" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aurateur</a>, a streamer with text-to-speech (TTS) donations enabled. His chat often spams donations to occupy much of the stream with TTS reading, taking advantage of the voice’s (Amazon Polly’s US English Joanna) many idiosyncracies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>nonsensical pronunciations, like
<button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('ragequit')">ragequit</button> and
<button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('avocado')">🥑</button>
<em>(click to play)</em></li>
<li>reading out full emoji names in order to prolong the donation’s TTS length per character, like <button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('hands')">🙌</button>,
<button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('sandwich')">🇬🇸</button>, and
<button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('emptiness')">🈳️</button></li>
<li>earthquakes and rhythmic sequences, like
<button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('aaaa')">ᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬᴬ</button>,
<button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('auau')">auauauauauauauau</button>,
<button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('llll')">llllllllllllll</button>, and
<button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('pxich')">pxichxijchpxichxijch</button></li>
<li>reading repeated
<button class="play-joanna" onclick="play('slash')">/ / / / / / / / / / / / / /</button> as an unusually long silence, which the self-declared <em>Silence Club</em> uses to fight back against the loyalist TTS spam</li>
</ul>
<p>This puzzle evolved out of this TTS idea after noticing the Olympics’ opening ceremony would be on the same day as the start of GPH, and liking the idea of using a screen reader to read a puzzle we couldn’t see. The underscore enumeration at the end of the puzzle is music to our ears. We used
<a href="https://ttsmp3.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ttsmp3.com</a> to generate Joanna’s audio for the puzzle. </p>
