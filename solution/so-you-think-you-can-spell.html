    <p>This puzzle is an homage to the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee">Spelling Bee</a> game published by
the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>The rules for the standard Spelling Bee game are explained on the NYT site and
are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Words must contain at least 4 letters.</li>
<li>Words must include the center letter.</li>
<li>Obscure words, proper nouns and hyphenated words are not accepted.</li>
<li>Letters can be used more than once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each word is worth some number of points:</p>
<ul>
<li>4-letter words are worth 1 point each.</li>
<li>Longer words earn 1 point per letter.</li>
<li>Each puzzle includes at least one ‚Äúpangram‚Äù which uses every letter. These are
worth 7 extra points!</li>
</ul>
<p>Each level has nine ranks based strictly on a percentage of possible total
points attainable. Genius is generally set at 70%.</p>
<p>This puzzle contains seven Spelling Bee levels each of which (besides the
first) contains some kind of twist. You can move on to the next level once you
reach Genius in the current level.</p>
<p>Once you reach Genius in the final level, you're given the answer to the puzzle:
<strong>BUMBLEBEE</strong>.</p>
<h4>Level 1: Standard Spelling Bee</h4>
<p>This level uses normal Spelling Bee rules to allow a chance for puzzlers
to familiarize themselves with the rules and scoring. It does however have an
unusually large set of valid words.</p>
<p>Left pangram: WEIRDLY</p>
<p>Right pangram: LOWBALLED</p>
<h4>Level 2: Funny Phrases</h4>
<p>Clicking on the rankings element opens up a dialog with a set of clues and
enumerations at the bottom. Each clue solves to a word or phrase that can be
made out of the 7 letters for this level. These phrases are the only accepted
entries.</p>

<h4>Level 3: Free Vowels</h4>
<p>Words in this level are allowed to use any of the 7 consonants present as well
as any vowels. Words must still use at least 4 (not necessarily unique)
included consonants and must still contain the center letter. There are no
pangrams in this level.</p>
<h4>Level 4: Doubled Center</h4>
<p>The required center letter is secretly doubled when the word is entered. The
resulting word must be a valid English word. For example, you may enter BOTLED
in the right version since that will be transformed into BOTTLED.</p>
<p>Left pangram: FLATFOTED</p>
<p>Right pangram: LIBRETO</p>
<h4>Level 5: Center Swap</h4>
<p>Every time you enter a word, that word's last letter swaps places to become the
new center letter. This allows access to a greater number of valid words.</p>
<p>Left pangram: KVETCHED</p>
<p>Right pangram: WIZARDRY</p>
<h4>Level 6: Pok√©mon</h4>
<p>While regular words are accepted, the rankings thresholds are so high that
they're mostly useless. As clued by the flavortext in the rankings dialog, each
side has six hidden Pok√©mon that can be made from the given letters. Each is
worth 400 points and finding all six is necessary to reach Genius.</p>
<p>Left Pok√©mon: AGGRON, ARON, GENGAR, GOGOAT, RATTATA, TORTERRA</p>
<p>Right Pok√©mon: DITTO, DODRIO, DRATINI, NIDORAN, NIDORINA, NIDORINO</p>
<h4>Level 7: Letter Increment</h4>
<p>Every time you enter a word, any outer letters that it uses are shifted forward
by one (A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on). If there are multiple identical
outer letters, only one is shifted forward. The standard pangram bonus is
awarded if the word uses all unique visible letters.</p>
<p>There are multiple possible solution paths to hit Genius, but the key is to
carefully manage the set of vowels you have available at any given point.
For example, while it may be tempting to start off the left side with the
pangram CHALICED (or even better, CICHLIDAE), this increments too many vowels
at once, leaving you with fewer to use for future words.</p>
<p>We've shown one possible solution path below.</p>
<p>Left example path: LEECHED ‚Üí ALFALFA ‚Üí BILGED ‚Üí CHILLI ‚Üí JELLIFIED (49 points)</p>
<p>Right example path: PILING ‚Üí PAJAMA ‚Üí EPHEBE ‚Üí POOF ‚Üí PICNICKING ‚Üí DOLLOP ‚Üí HEMP ‚Üí PIPPIN ‚Üí POOP (50 points)</p>
<h4>Left/Right Answers</h4>
<p>The left and right answers needed for this round's meta can be found by extracting the initial center letter of each level. Doing so gives us <strong>REMOVAL</strong> and <strong>DAYTRIP</strong> for the left and right answers, respectively.</p>



    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>A few of us regularly do the NYT Spelling Bee together. When we get stuck on finding more actual words (or at least what the New York Times considers actual words), we often point out interesting non-words that could be made, including Pok√©mon, proper nouns, and phrases. Parts of this puzzle offer a glimpse into what that's like. In fact, level 2 was written by looking at the letter sets, pretending we were stuck, and throwing the usual silly suggestions out there.</p>
