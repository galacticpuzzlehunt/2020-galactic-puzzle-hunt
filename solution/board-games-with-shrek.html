    <p>This is a board game conundrum, where in each chapter, Shrek, Donkey, and Lord Farquaad play a board game. A few turns into the board game, the players stop playing, and Shrek makes an observation that produces a number.</p>
<p>The main conceit of the puzzle is that the conundrum, as written, isn't fully defined. Most noticeably, it's never specified which player is the first, second, or third player.</p>
<p>The main observation is that all of these games have particular rules to determine who the first player is. For example, in Hanabi, it's the player with the most colorful clothes, or in Mint Works, it's the player with the freshest breath. Chapter 1 sets up a specific time in the Shrek storyline that this happens, during the wedding of Fiona and Farquaad in Shrek 1, making these unambiguous. Chapter 1 also establishes how the players are seated around a table, and in most cases (except one) the manual specifies that the game goes clockwise. This lets us fill in this table:</p>
<table><tr><th>Game</th><th>First player rule</th><th>First player</th><th>Rationale</th></tr><tr><td>Hanabi</td><td><a href="https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/b3/a9/0e-hanabi-rulebook.pdf">player with the most colorful clothing</a></td><td>Lord Farquaad</td><td>Farquaad is wearing red, Shrek wears brown, Donkey does not have clothes.</td></tr><tr><td>Takenoko</td><td><a href="https://www.matagot.com/docs/Takenoko_rules_EN.pdf">the tallest player</a></td><td>Shrek</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Terror in Meeple City</td><td><a href="https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/29/71/c1-terror-in-meeple-city-rulebook.pdf">player who does the most convincing imitation of a giant monster</a></td><td>Shrek</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Small World</td><td><a href="https://ncdn1.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/img/sw_rules_2015_en.pdf">player whose ears are the most pointed</a></td><td>Donkey</td><td>Shrek's ears are round-tipped, not pointed.</td></tr><tr><td>Simurgh</td><td><a href="https://cdn.tabletopia.com/games/simurgh/rules/simurgh-rules/en">player who last rode a dragon</a></td><td>Donkey</td><td>Although Shrek and Donkey ride Dragon earlier in the movie, Donkey rides Dragon alone afterward.</td></tr><tr><td>The Grizzled</td><td><a href="https://cmon-files.s3.amazonaws.com/The-Grizzled-Rulebook-US.pdf">the hairiest player</a></td><td>Donkey</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mint Works</td><td><a href="https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/d7/7a/02-mint-works-rulebook.pdf">the player with the freshest breath</a></td><td>Lord Farquaad</td><td>Donkey establishes that Shrek has bad breath, and it's arguable that Farquaad would have fresher breath than a donkey.</td></tr><tr><td>Le Havre</td><td><a href="https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules2/lehavre-rules.pdf">the player who lives closest to water</a></td><td>Shrek</td><td>Shrek's last home was in a swamp, next to water.</td></tr></table>

<p>Knowing the first player for each board game makes following the steps mostly straightforward. Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hanabi has a logic puzzle using X, Y, and Z. The first step is to notice that everyone must have had cards pointed to, as otherwise it'd be impossible for everyone to know the numbers of their cards. Hence X, Y, and Z must be 1, 2, and 3, in some order. The Xth and Yth players each had X+Y of their cards pointed to. Since at least one of these players did not discard any cards, that means X+Y = 3 and hence Z = 3. From there, the third player had X of their cards pointed to, then discarded a card, then the first player must have given them a clue. Hence X = 2 and Y = 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Takenoko's plot placement involves a logic puzzle. From the placement of irrigation channels, we know that plots 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 3 and 6, and 1 and 4 are adjacent. It's described that plots 1 and 6 are adjacent too, and that plot 7 is on the lower-right of plot 3. From the movement of the gardener, there is a straight line going from plot 1 to 5. The scenarios in which plot 5 isn't adjacent to plot 1 can be ruled out. Hence the plots adjacent to 1 are plots 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the pond, in some order. Using the information from the fourth turn, this constrains the game to two possibilities, which are mirror images of each other. The tiles around the first tile are the pond, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, either clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terror in Meeple City is straightforward. If the second player could have collected one meeple of every color in the second turn, he would have had ten more points. It follows the first player must have knocked out one of the second player's teeth. The only turns that matter for extraction are Shrek and Donkey's. Shrek has 3×4 points from Teeth left because of Softie, and 2 points from the tooth; Donkey has 2 floors and thus 2 points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Small World, we realize that the third player is Shrek from the first player rules. Hence most of the turns of the first and second players do not matter. The first and second players each put one coin on the combo that the third player took, and the third player paid two coins to get that combo. So the total number of coins Shrek had in the end was 5+2−2 = 5, the initial number of coins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Simurgh, the first player gets one vegetable from placing tile #24, then exchanges one vegetable for two Meat. Then the first player uses four vegetables and/or Meat for the Dragon Ability, leaving either one vegetable or meat; the exact resource doesn't matter. The second player exchanges one wood and stone for two weapons in the Forge, then the Dragon Ability exchanges two vegetables for two wood and two stone. Finally, the third player receives two vegetables, and in the Barracks uses three vegetables and one meat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Grizzled begins with a small math puzzle. The manual says there are 39 Trials cards, and each of the 6 Threats appears 14 times. Using this information, it is possible to deduce that most cards have exactly two Threats, except for two which have three Threats and one which has six Threats. The mission fails when a threat appears thrice; hence as there are six threats, the maximum number of threats that can be on No Man's Land is 12. This can be achieved with cards with 2+2+2+2+2+2 threats, or cards with 3+3+6 threats, giving the construction for N and M. As the players play one card per turn, in the first mission, each player played two cards, and in the second mission, each player played one card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Mint Works, the first player pays one mint for the Supplier, pays two mints on the Builder to build the Co-op, gets a mint from the Co-op, and gets another mint from Upkeep. The second player pays one mint on the Producer to gain two mints, then pays one mint on Leadership Council to get one mint, and gets another mint from Upkeep. The third player pays one mint on the Producer to gain two mints, gets a mint from the Co-op, and gets another mint from Upkeep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Le Havre involves a logic puzzle of trying to figure out the order of the round supply tiles. The manual has a clear picture of which supplies are in each tile. The final configuration of offer spaces constrains the order entirely. Because Cattle, Grain, and Iron ended up empty, and as only one token puts Cattle, Grain, or Iron, these three tokens must come first, in that order. As one Wood is left in the end, the next two supply tiles must put Wood; and there's only one possibility that leaves one Clay at the end. The order of the last two is then determined by the fact there were no Fish left at the end.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the instructions in the conundrum produces a number between 1 and 26 for each board game:</p>
<table><tr><th>Game</th><th>Extraction</th><th>Number</th><th>Letter</th></tr><tr><td>Hanabi</td><td>3×(3+3+2) + (3+3+1) – 2×(2+2+1)</td><td>21</td><td>U</td></tr><tr><td>Takenoko</td><td>3×(3+2+0) + (2+0) – (1+2)</td><td>14</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>Terror in Meeple City</td><td>(3×4+2) + (2×1)</td><td>16</td><td>P</td></tr><tr><td>Small World</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>E</td></tr><tr><td>Simurgh</td><td>(1+0+1 + 0+1+0 + 1+2+1 + 1+2+1) + (2 + 2)</td><td>15</td><td>O</td></tr><tr><td>The Grizzled</td><td>2×5 + 2×2 + 2</td><td>16</td><td>P</td></tr><tr><td>Mint Works</td><td>2×5 + 2</td><td>12</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>Le Havre</td><td>(5+2+4+1) – (2+5+0)</td><td>5</td><td>E</td></tr></table>

<p>Converting these to letters, with A=1, B=2, etc., gives the answer <strong>UNPEOPLE</strong>, a suitable response to Shrek’s question, “Why am I being treated like I don’t exist?”</p>



    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>I really wanted to include the game Cube Quest, with the rule “whoever has a squarer head goes first”, but it’s a two player game. Other neat rules are Noah, “the shortest player begins the first round, as they’re the most concerned with the rising water”, The Bridges of Shangri-La, “whoever has last reached the peak of Mount Everest using nothing but blue and white checkered stilts carved from the wood of a Mammoth tree”, and Sheepland, “the most recent player to caress a sheep.”</p>
